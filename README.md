# Triad Arena

Rise of the Triad (1994)'s multiplayer modes reimplemented in the [FTEQW](https://www.fteqw.org/) engine.

There is an official packages repository for additional levels and goodies,
which can be found [here](https://github.com/erysdren/TriadArena-Packages).

This project is **heavily work-in-progress** and no functionality is guaranteed.
Use at your own risk.

## Todo

- [x] Add support for loading ROTT:LE mapset files.
- [ ] Create package for [Dakkijam: The Precursor](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3389350415).
- [ ] Add support for using shareware game data instead of registered.

## Required Files

Place these in `triadarena/data/`.
